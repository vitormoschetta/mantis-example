# Mantis Examples

This repository contains an example of how to run Mantis with a few mappings containing the different ways of matching that Mantis supports.

To run it, simply run `docker-compose up -d` in the terminal.

Check the `mappings` folder and make requests to port `8090` to try and match with the mapping definitions.
